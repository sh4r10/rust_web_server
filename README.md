# Multi Threaded Rust Server

A basic implementation of a multithreaded rust server utilizing a threadpool to limit the number of concurrent requests.
Currently the project only servers three files, an index.html, a style.css and a 404.html.

This project is the final project in [The Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html)
